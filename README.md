Other readme docs here, in the docs folder, and other folders.



README-installation-notes.md is pretty good as of 2019-03-31

README-instructions*.md did have consise instructions -- but things changed.

*notes*.md files are just many jotted notes - less organized.

Shopping List is an Offline First demo Progressive Web App built using Vue.js and PouchDB.

I used this CRUD app and modified the api calls to `pouch-vue` calls.
