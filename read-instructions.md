# Instructions

## build.sh

Use `make b` to assemble the js files into the main shopping list js file. The files will be concatenated sorted by the numerical value in the name.


## Docker-compose

Docker compose file will run the project. 

There are some things that are not automatically done on startup.

    - postgres tables for the couch to postgres replication
    - I need to add more to this list.
