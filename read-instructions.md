# Instructions

## build.sh

Use `make b` to assemble the js files into the main shopping list js file.

## Docker-compose

Docker compose file will run the project. 

There are some things that are not automatically done on startup.

    - postgres tables for the couch to postgres replication
    - I need to add more to this list.

    
# Issues

 - difficult to update js and css in android.
 - possibly look for better way to split up the js and html file into smaller files.

# Todo

 - documentation
 - add autocomplete from data table
 - add search
 - address the need of knowing who edited what piece of info. login? authentication? require name with pin?
 - is role based access needed?
